# Firebase Integration Fixes

This document explains the fixes applied to resolve the Firebase integration issues in the GitHub Pages deployment.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Duplicate `currentUser` Declaration**
   - Problem: Both `auth.js` and `firebase-integration.js` declared a variable named `currentUser`, causing a JavaScript error.
   - Solution: Renamed the variable in `auth.js` to `localCurrentUser` to avoid the conflict.

2. **Firestore Database Not Found Error**
   - Problem: The Firestore database doesn't exist for the project "pano-vqa-annotation".
   - Solution: Added graceful fallback to localStorage when Firestore is not available, allowing the application to function even without a Firestore database.

## Next Steps

### 1. Create a Firestore Database (Recommended)

For full functionality, you should create a Firestore database in your Firebase project:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project "pano-vqa-annotation"
3. Navigate to "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Create database"
5. Choose either production mode or test mode (test mode is easier for development)
6. Select a location close to your users
7. Click "Enable"

### 2. Update GitHub Pages Deployment

After making these changes, you should redeploy to GitHub Pages:

1. Commit and push the changes to your repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Firebase integration issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy the changes to GitHub Pages.

3. If you prefer to deploy manually, you can use the provided script:
   ```bash
   ./manual-deploy.sh
   ```

## Testing

After deployment, you should test the following:

1. **Authentication**: Verify that users can log in without errors.
2. **Data Storage**: Verify that annotations can be saved and retrieved.
3. **Admin Dashboard**: If you're an admin, verify that the admin dashboard works correctly.

## Fallback Behavior

With these changes, the application will:

1. Try to use Firebase Authentication and Firestore if available.
2. Fall back to localStorage for data storage if Firestore is not available or encounters errors.

This ensures that the application remains functional even if there are issues with the Firebase services.

## Additional Notes

- The Firebase API key in `firebase-config.js` is valid, but you may want to restrict its usage in the Firebase Console to prevent unauthorized use.
- If you continue to experience issues, you can temporarily disable Firebase by commenting out the Firebase SDK scripts in the HTML files.
